## R Notebooks
This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute 
code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

R code goes in **code chunks**, denoted by three backticks. Try executing this 
chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor 
inside it and pressing *Crtl+Shift+Enter* (Windows) or *Cmd+Shift+Enter* (Mac).

## Setup

The setup chunk always runs before anything else. 
Don't worry about this step so much for now!
```{r setup}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

## Warm up

Explore the R console. What do you expect the following to output?
```{r}
3*4
```

You can assign the result of this calculation to an object using: 
```{r}
x <- 3*4
x
```

What do you expect the following lines to output?
```{r}
x + 8

x ** 2
```

Preview: What do you expect this to return?
```{r}
x < 13
```

## Comments
In R, lines that are preceded by a hashtag, `#`, will not be run:
```{r}
# If you execute this chunk, 
# nothing will happen
# This is a good way to write notes directly in your code to explain things

# Even if I write commands that look like R commands
# x <- 1 + 2
x
```

Notice that `x` still has the value we initially assigned it. 

## Naming Objects
Object names cannot start with a digit and cannot contain certain characters 
such as a comma or a space. A common convention adopted in naming R object is 
"snakecase".

```{r}
this_object_is_named_using_snake_case <- 3*4

this_object_is_named_using_snake_case

# other.people.use.periods
#evenOthersUseCamelCase
```

## Object types
So far we worked mostly with numbers, but R can handle many types of objects:
```{r}
some_text <- "this is called a string"
typeof(some_text)

a_number <- 12
typeof(a_number)

true_or_false <- TRUE
typeof(true_or_false)

```
* `strings` are where we store text, denoted by quotation marks. 
* `doubles` are where we store numeric data
* `logicals` are where we store the result of a logical operation: 

These are the most common unitary types, but you will see others, such as 
vectors and matrices as you progress through R! 

## Logical operators and expressions
We can ask true or false questions about objects in R. 

### Exercise:
I have filled in the first few answers, but try to figure out what all 
these logical operators do:

```{r}
a_number

# Try 
# `==` means 'is equal to'
a_number == 12

# `!=` means ...
a_number != 10
a_number != 12

# `<` means ...
a_number < 10

# `>` means ...

# `<=` means ...

# `=>` means ...

```

## Vectors
An object doesn't need to have only one value in it. We can store multiple 
values in a vector: 
``` {r}
weight_kg <- 57.5
weight_lb <- weight_kg * 2.2

# a vector
weights <- c(weight_kg, weight_lb)
weights

names <- c("Jamie", "Melanie", "Julie")
names

names[1]
```

Your turn!

Create a vector that contains the different weights of four fish (you pick the object name!):
* one fish: 12 kg
two fish: 34 kg
red fish: 20 kg
blue fish: 6.6 kg

Convert the vector of kilos to pounds (hint: 1 kg = 2.2 pounds).

Calculate the total weight. (hint: type `?sum` in the console)

## Functions
There are many ways to calculate the sum of the vector you made above. One of 
them is by using the `sum()` function. 
* Functions take arguments and return values. 
* Some functions take no arguments (e.g. `date()`)
* Functions have help files which can be found by calling `?function()`

### Exercise: 
Using the code chunk below, call the documentation for the following 
functions, and try to figure out what they do (I have done the first one for you): 
* `min()`
* `max()`
* `mean()`
* `log()`

```{r}
# Hint, you can use the arrows above the help file viewer to scroll between each 
# help file you've called. 
?min
```

## Packages
So far, the functions we have seen exist in "base R". This means, they are all 
installed automatically when you install R. 

You can install MANY other packages from CRAN (R's most used package repository) 
by calling:
```{r}
# install.packages("praise")
```

You must then load the package into the current R session by calling:
```{r}
library("praise")
```

Finally, you can look up the documentation for the package (tips on how to use 
it) by calling: 
```{r}
?praise
```


## R Markdown
This whole time, we have been editing an R Markdown file, and keeping track of 
our code directly in this file. RMarkdown files are powerful ways to document 
and execute reproducible research. 

### Exercise
Try clicking the `Knit` button at the top of the page, and see what happens. 

# Take aways
R, RStudio and RMarkdown are three powerful tools that can help you conduct 
reproducible research:
* R is the engine, which comes out of the box with useful functions, "base R"
* RStudio is the car, providing a powerful interface for interacting with R
* RMarkdown doesn't fit will with this analogy, but is useful for documenting 
your research, and proving others can reach the same results given the same 
input
